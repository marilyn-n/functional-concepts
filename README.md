# Functional Concepts

An intoduction to functional paradigma using ECMAScript 6.

This reflects the LISP heritage of JavaScript.

## Pure Functions 

A pure function has two features:
 
 * No side effects - does not affect the state of the outside.  
 * Referential transparency - the same inputs always produce the same return output.

 Pure functions are the most important functional concept because:
 * they are easier to read
 * more compact
 * focused - Linux philosophy of making small sharp tools.
 * reusable
 * easier to debug - focus on expected output for given input, by thinking about the body statements.
